# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves the complete integration of Appwrite backend services into the Madhubani Nikah Islamic matrimony platform. The integration will replace all existing mock data with real-time database operations, implement comprehensive authentication, user profiles, search functionality, matching algorithms, and admin controls. The platform will become production-ready with full CRUD operations, real-time updates, file storage, and advanced filtering capabilities specific to the Madhubani district and Islamic matrimony requirements.
